#   📊 GitHub-Python-Stars-Analysis
An analysis of the most-starred Python projects on GitHub using data pulled from the GitHub API, processed with Python, and visualized with Plotly.


This project visualizes the most-starred Python repositories on GitHub, highlighting popular projects in the Python community.

### 🔍 Overview
We use the GitHub API to retrieve data about the top-starred Python repositories, process the data with Python's json() method, and visualize the results with plotly.express.

### 📦 How It Works
Data Collection: A GET request is made to the GitHub API to fetch repository information.
Data Processing: The data is parsed and processed using Python to extract repository names and star counts.
Visualization: The processed data is visualized using plotly.express to create a bar chart showcasing the most-starred Python projects on GitHub.

### 📈 Results
The bar chart displays repositories like public-apis, Python, Auto-GPT, and system-design-primer as some of the most popular Python projects on GitHub.
